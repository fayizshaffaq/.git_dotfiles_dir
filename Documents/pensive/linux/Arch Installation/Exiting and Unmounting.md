This is the final step within the live installation environment. After configuring the new system from within the `chroot` jail, you must exit it and cleanly unmount the partitions before rebooting into your new Arch Linux installation.

## 1. Exit the `chroot` Environment

First, exit from the `chroot` environment to return to the shell of the live installation media.

```bash
exit
```

## 2. Unmount All Partitions

Next, unmount all the partitions you previously mounted under `/mnt`. The `-R` (recursive) option ensures that all nested mount points (like `/mnt/boot` and `/mnt/home`) are unmounted correctly.

```bash
umount -R /mnt
```

> [!NOTE] Correct Spelling
> Be careful to use the command `umount` (without an "n"). A common typo is `unmount`, which will result in an error.

> [!WARNING] Data Integrity
> Failing to unmount the partitions before rebooting can lead to filesystem corruption. This step is critical for a clean shutdown of the installation process.

After successfully unmounting the partitions, you are now ready to restart your machine. You can do this with the `shutdown now` command.

```bash
shutdown now
```

Upon shuttingdown, remember to remove the installation media (USB drive) to ensure you boot into your newly installed Arch Linux system.
