TuneD is a system tuning service for Linux. It provides a number of pre-configured tuning profiles, each optimized for unique workload characteristics, including CPU-intensive job needs, storage/network throughput responsiveness, or power consumption reduction.

Enable and start the TuneD service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now tuned
```

Find out which TuneD profile is currently active.

```bash
tuned-adm active
```

Current active profile: balanced

```bash
tuned-adm list
```

set the profile to virtual-host. This optimizes the host for running KVM guests.

```bash
sudo tuned-adm profile virtual-host
```

Check that the TuneD profile has been updated and that virtual-host is now active.

```bash
tuned-adm active
```

Make sure there are no errors.

```bash
sudo tuned-adm verify
```
