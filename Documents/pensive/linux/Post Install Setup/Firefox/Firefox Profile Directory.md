Locating Your Profile Directory

The entire configuration is stored within a single hidden folder in your home directory: `~/.mozilla`.

Your Firefox profile contains all your personal settings, bookmarks, and the folder where your custom CSS file will live.

1.  Open a new tab and navigate to `about:profiles`.

2.  Identify the profile that is currently in use (it will usually be marked as **"This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted."**).

3.  In that profile's section, find the **Root Directory** line and click the **Open Directory** button.
    > [!TIP] Your Profile Folder
    > This will open your system's file manager directly inside your unique profile folder (if you're using yazi, then the path to it will be opened in the terminal, open yazi with 'y' from the terminal and it'll place you in the requisite directory automatically ), alternatively you can have the terminal print the working directory and navigate to it manually type in 'pwd'.  (e.g., `xxxxxxxx.default-release`).
