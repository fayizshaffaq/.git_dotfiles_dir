### Step 3: Create a Custom `git_dotfiles` Alias

It would be intolerably cumbersome to specify the repository location for every command. To solve this, we will create a shell alias that acts as a proxy to Git, pre-configured to work with our dotfiles repository.

1.  **Open your shell's configuration file.** The example uses `zsh`; if you use Bash, edit `~/.bashrc` instead.
    ```bash
    nvim ~/.zshrc
    ```

2.  **Add the following alias.** This is the most critical step for usability.
    ```bash
    # Alias for managing dotfiles with a bare git repo
    alias git_dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.git_dotfiles_dir/ --work-tree=$HOME'
    ```
    *   `--git-dir=$HOME/.git_dotfiles_dir/`: Tells Git where to find its database (our bare repository).
    *   `--work-tree=$HOME`: Tells Git that the working directory for this repository is your home directory.

3.  **Apply the changes** to your current shell session.
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
