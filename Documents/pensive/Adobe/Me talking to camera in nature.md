Do you see this around me? this is what i've been depriving myself of for the last 63 days. all because I wanted to try out linux and see for myself if it was a serious windows replaceable OS, now the thing is i've always liked windows as an OS because I used to like to game. emphasis on used to. So anyways.  My first 4 days of using linux mint was underwhelming, It was easy alright, everything had a gui. 
but the ui looked like it was designed in prehistoric age. and it wouldn't click for me. so i was like is there something better else out there. and oh there was! I burned the fedora iso on my thumb drive and used it, I loved it, it was not boring because it was truly different with a modern ui and a unique way of managing apps, i mean there was no minimize button and i liked it. so after using it for about 2 weeks i got tired of it. cuz it still didnt feel all that diffrent from what i was used to in windows. and then I watched a video on Arch linux, and it peaked my interest. This is where i made a decision that would consume every waking second of my life for the next 65 days. I gravely underestimated how truly difficult building your own operating OS would be, and because i'm a masocist, i went the manual installation route, mind you, i had barely learnt anything about linux from using mint and fedora, because those destoros are plug and play with everything preconfigured to just work. so anyways because i truly wanted to learn linux i read the entire arch wiki installation guide in excrutiating detail and took meticulas notes for the next two days. now arch wiki is not really adhd friendly, It's painfully boaring to read it, they overload you with information especially if you click all the hyprlinks like i did, it quickly turns into a rabbit hole., and i honestly the only thing that kept me going was the sunk cost fallocy, i didn't want to have wasted all my time and give up, so I pushed myself through it and came out the other end with a solid understanding of how linux worked. and then i also had to curate a list of pacakges i wanted, the process of searching for packages and realising how i had to download a package for literlly every single thing gave me a true appriciation for how modular linux is, there's absolutely zero stuff on my setup that i didn't intentionally put there. Everysingle thing is handpicked by me. which makes it so much personal. and it's not like there's one package for each thing, There's like 10 alternatives for each and evyrthign thing. for instance for network setup, you can choose from a list of all these things, and given that i like to know the difference between all of them and pick the best one for my needs, i had to research each and everything one by one, which took another 2 days. Honestly the whole process would have been such a pain in the rear end if it weren't for the conviniance of having my questions answered on a whim by chatgpt. 
i know we get used to things so fast but god damn what a truly magical thing it is. Obviously you can't trust everything it says and you have to double check and cross verify but the fact that something like this exists is truly insane.
