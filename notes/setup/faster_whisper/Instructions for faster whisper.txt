Python 3.9 or greater
if there is ever a python verstion constraint use pyenv to use a supported python version for the environment

	CREATE A PYTHON ENVIRONMENT FIRST TO ISOLATE IT
mkdir fasterwhisper
cd fasterwhisper
python -m venv fasterwhisper_venv
source fasterwhisper_venv/bin/activate


	install faster-whisper
pip install faster-whisper

	after the installation is done use teh exisiting config.py to run the script to download a model you can change the model if you so want by specifying it, rn the default is small.en ,(the script is configured to look for an audio file in the RAM disk mic directory)

python config.py
-----------------------X--------------------

	FROM OUTSIDE THE PYTHON ENVIRONMENT (AUTOMATED)
to automate the process of the entire thing a script has been made to record, to initiate the python environment to transcribe the text and to copy the text to clipboard in a well formatted way just make sure to edit the user defined facts and the scripts at the top

./faster_whisper_sst.sh






--------------------------------
  this command is to be run first to find out your pc's audio source
pactl list short sources

recording audio with ffpepeg
ffmpeg -f pulse -i 'alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1f.3-platform-skl_hda_dsp_generic.HiFi_Mic1_source' /mnt/ramdisk/mic/1_mic.wav
			

for transcribing stt whisper
./whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli -m /home/fayiz/whisper.cpp/ggml_model/ggml-base.en.bin -f /mnt/ramdisk/mic/1_mic.wav
