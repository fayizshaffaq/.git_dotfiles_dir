  SYSTEMCTL VS LOGINCTL FOR SUTTING DOWN AND LOGGING OUT AND OTHERS. 
------------------

  for hyprland initiated by uwsm, DON'T EVER USE window manager/desktop manager's native commands because the session is managed by uwsm. only use loginctl , and only when necessory use systemctl but never session's native mecanism to wind down the active session.
  only use these user level commands,the last flag is for logging out gracefuly.
  loginctl followed by any of these flags. 
  poweroff, reboot, suspend,loginctl terminate-session $XDG_SESSION_ID,

  if you're in a tty and haven't yet initialized a wm/dm use systemctl.
    systemctl followed by :-
    poweroff, reboot, suspend, soft-reboot, hybrid-sleep
