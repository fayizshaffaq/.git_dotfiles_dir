  first run this command to see if your wifi card support it, most modern cards do, you are looking for AP under supported interface modes. 

iw list 

  Supported interface modes:
     * IBSS
     * managed
     * AP  <-- THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED
     * AP/VLAN
     * monitor
     * P2P-client
     * P2P-GO  

Identify Your Network Interfaces: You need to know the name of your Wi-Fi interface (e.g., wlan0, wlp3s0) and the interface that has internet (e.g., eth0, enp5s0 for Ethernet, or maybe another Wi-Fi card).

nmcli device
  or 
ip a 

  in my case it's wlo1

  Create the hotspot with one command:

  Replace wlo1, "MyArchHotspot", and "supersecretpassword" with your Wi-Fi interface, desired network name, and password.
  
nmcli device wifi hotspot ifname wlo1 ssid "MyArchHotspot" password "supersecretpassword"

  explination of the command. 
      ifname wlo1: The Wi-Fi interface to use.

    ssid "MyArchHotspot": Your hotspot's name.

    password "supersecretpassword": Your password (must be at least 8 characters).

  To turn off the hotspot:
  First, find the connection name (it will likely be your SSID):

nmcli connection show

  Then, take the connection down:

nmcli connection down "MyArchHotspot"

   shows the Wi-Fi name and password.

nmcli dev wifi show-password
