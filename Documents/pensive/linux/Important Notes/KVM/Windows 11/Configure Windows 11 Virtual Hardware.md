Start the Virtual Machine Manager application.

Before you begin creating a Windows 11 guest virtual machine, you must first enable XML editing because you will need to add the Hyper-V XML component later in this section.

Go to Edit > Preferences and Enable XML editing under general.

After that, click the computer icon in the upper left corner. that when hovered on says `create new virtual mechine`

This will launch a wizard that will guide you through the process of creating a new virtual machine in easy steps.
