VGA = Video Graphics Array

“VGA” in the PCI‑passthrough world is more than just an old monitor plug—it’s the legacy graphics interface and BIOS routines that every PC video card implements so the system firmware and operating systems know how to draw the very first pixels on your screen. When you fire up a virtual machine, QEMU gives it a simple, software‑only VGA adapter so you can see text and basic graphics even without a real GPU. But when you passthrough a physical card, you’re handing over not only its processor and memory but also its built‑in VGA controller and firmware, which handle all the low‑level I/O ports, memory registers, and boot‑time video output. Because only one VGA device can “own” these special resources at a time, you use options like x-vga=on (and often supply the card’s ROM image) so that the guest OS can fully claim the card’s VGA functions instead of the host hogging them. The end result is that your VM boots with the card’s real boot splash, supports high resolutions, hardware acceleration, and behaves exactly like a physical machine hooked straight into your GPU.
