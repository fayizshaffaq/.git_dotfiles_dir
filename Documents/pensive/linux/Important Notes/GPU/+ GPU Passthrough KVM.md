VFIO (Virtual Function I/O):
> This is the Linux kernel driver that lets a VM directly control a real PCI device.

vfio-pci.
> This is a VFIO driver, meaning it fulfills the same role as pci-stub did, but it can also control devices to an extent, such as by switching them into their D3 state when they are not in use. 

Providing the device IDs is done via the kernel module parameter ids=10de:13c2,10de:0fbb for vfio-pci.

> stands for Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O and should not be confused with VT-x Intel Virtualization Technology. VT-x allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms while VT-d improves security and reliability of the systems and also improves performance of I/O devices in vitalized environments.

cpu support for IOMMU
motherboard/bios support for IOMMU
GPU ROM must support UEFI






IOMMU is a generic name for Intel VT-d and AMD-Vi

IOMMU VS DMA?
