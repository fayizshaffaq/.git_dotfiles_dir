Install Python and Pip (if not present):

sudo pacman -U <package-file.pkg.tar.zst> #You need to install them in a specific order if there are dependencies among them.

--------------------

Install PyTorch from Local Files
cd /mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/python_packages

Install PyTorch and its components using pip. The --no-index flag tells pip not to look online, and --find-links tells it where to find the packages.

(The . means "look in the current directory"). Ensure all downloaded PyTorch related .whl files are in this directory.

--no-index is specifically designed to prevent external lookups so don't use that if there might be additional dependiencies that aren't present locally. to use the hybrid mehtond of utilizing local and downlaoding the onces that aren't present use without --no-index

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --no-index --find-links=.

----------------------

Install NeMo Toolkit from Local Files:
Similarly, install NeMo: 

This will install NeMo and its dependencies from the files you downloaded. Make sure all dependency .whl files for nemo_toolkit["asr"] are present in this directory. pip download should have grabbed them.

cd /mnt/my_external_drive/offline_asr_setup/python_packages
pip install nemo_toolkit["asr"] --no-index --find-links=.

PROJECT_DIR="/mnt/zram1/stt"
-----------
Step 1: Prepare Your Project Directory

First, create a directory where you'll set up your virtual environment and store your transcription scripts.

mkdir -p $PROJECT_DIR
cd $PROJECT_DIR

--------------
Step 2: Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project-specific dependencies.

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

python -m venv .venv: This command creates a virtual environment named .venv inside your current project directory ($PROJECT_DIR). Using .venv is a common convention. This environment will have its own Python interpreter and pip instance, isolated from your system's global Python packages.

source .venv/bin/activate: This command activates the virtual environment. Your terminal prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active (e.g., (.venv) user@host:...$). Now, any Python packages you install will be placed in this environment.

----------------

Step 3: Install Python Packages from Local Files

This is the core of the offline installation. We will use pip install with flags to point to your local wheel files and prevent any internet access.

Install PyTorch (CPU Version)

pip install --no-index --find-links=$PYTORCH_CPU_WHEELS_DIR torch torchvision torchaudio

Install NeMo Toolkit and its Dependencies

pip install --no-index --find-links=$NEMO_WHEELS_DIR nemo_toolkit[asr]

-------------------
if any of the commands fail because of a dependency erors and after all dependenciiees have been met, make sure to purge cache and run the install commands again.

pip cache purge

if you get an error with sentencepiece, it's because it's not installed, install it from the AUR

paru -S sentencepiece
--------------------

test if they were all sucessfully installed, SHOULD PRINT FALSE for cuda because this is cpu only

python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}'); import nemo.utils; print('NeMo utils imported successfully')"

# Setting Up Parakreet for Offline ASR on Arch Linux

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough for setting up the NVIDIA NeMo Parakreet model for offline Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) on Arch Linux. The process has been carefully tested and involves two main phases:
1.  **Preparation:** Gathering all necessary packages, libraries, and models while you have an internet connection.
2.  **Installation:** Assembling the environment on a target machine, which can be fully offline.

> [!IMPORTANT] Follow these instructions precisely
> The steps and commands outlined below have been validated through significant trial and error. Do not deviate from them to ensure a successful installation.

---

## Part 1: Preparation (Online) - Gathering All Assets

Before proceeding with the offline installation, you must first download all the required components. This section details how to collect everything you need.

### Step 1: Create the Directory Structure

First, create a structured set of directories to keep your downloaded assets organized. This is crucial for the offline installation scripts to work correctly.

```bash
# Create parent directories for packages, models, and Arch packages
mkdir -p /mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/python_packages
mkdir -p /mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/nemo_models
mkdir -p /mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/arch_packages
```

### Step 2: Download Core Arch Packages

Download the package files for `python` and `python-pip` without installing them. They will be saved to your specified directory for later offline installation.

```bash
# Download packages to the 'arch_packages' directory
sudo pacman -Sw python python-pip --cachedir /mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/arch_packages/
```

### Step 3: Download Python Wheels

We will use `pip download` to fetch all necessary Python packages and their dependencies as `.whl` (wheel) files.

#### A. PyTorch Wheels

Choose **one** of the following commands based on your target hardware (CPU or NVIDIA GPU).

> [!NOTE]
> The `xyz` in the destination path should be replaced with a descriptive folder name like `pytorch_cpu` or `pytorch_cuda_cu128` for clarity.

**For CPU-Only Systems:**
```bash
pip download torch torchvision torchaudio \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu \
  --resume-retries 5 \
  --dest /mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/python_packages/pytorch_cpu
```

**For NVIDIA GPU (CUDA 12.8):**
```bash
pip download torch torchvision torchaudio \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128 \
  --resume-retries 5 \
  --dest /mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/python_packages/pytorch_cuda_cu128
```

#### B. NeMo Toolkit Wheels

Download the NeMo ASR toolkit and its dependencies.

```bash
# Place these in a dedicated 'nvidia_NeMo' folder
pip download nemo_toolkit["asr"] \
  --dest /mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/python_packages/nvidia_NeMo
```

#### C. Additional NeMo Dependencies

NeMo requires specific build dependencies. Download them into the same directory as the NeMo toolkit wheels.

```bash
pip download "Cython<3.1,>=0.29.34" "meson-python<0.16.0,>=0.15.0" cmake pdm-backend "patchelf>=0.11.0" \
  --dest /mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/python_packages/nvidia_NeMo
```

### Step 4: Download the Parakreet Model

Download the pre-trained Parakreet model files from Hugging Face and place them in your `nemo_models` directory.

*   **Model Link:** [nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2/tree/main)
*   **Target Directory:** `/mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/nemo_models/`

---

## Part 2: Offline Installation & Configuration (CPU-Only Example)

This section details the process of setting up the environment on the target machine using the assets you gathered in Part 1.

### Step 1: Define Environment Variables

For convenience, define shell variables pointing to your asset locations. This makes the installation commands cleaner and easier to manage.

```bash
# Directory for local Arch Linux packages
export ARCH_PKG_DIR="/mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/arch_packages"

# Directory for PyTorch CPU wheel files
export PYTORCH_CPU_WHEELS_DIR="/mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/python_packages/pytorch_cpu/"

# Directory for NeMo Toolkit wheel files
export NEMO_WHEELS_DIR="/mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/python_packages/nvidia_NeMo/"

# Directory for the downloaded ASR model
export MODEL_DIR="/mnt/zram1/offline_asr_setup/nemo_models/"

# The main project directory for our application
export PROJECT_DIR="/mnt/zram1/stt"
```

### Step 2: Prepare the Project Directory

Create the main directory for your speech-to-text project and navigate into it.

```bash
mkdir -p $PROJECT_DIR
cd $PROJECT_DIR
```

### Step 3: Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment is essential for isolating dependencies and avoiding conflicts with system-wide packages.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named .venv
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```
> [!TIP] Check Your Prompt
> After activation, your shell prompt will be prefixed with `(.venv)`, indicating the virtual environment is active. All subsequent `pip` commands will operate within this isolated environment.

### Step 4: Install Python Packages from Local Files

This is the core of the offline installation. We use the `--no-index` flag to prevent `pip` from accessing the internet and `--find-links` to specify the local directory containing our wheel files.

#### A. Install PyTorch (CPU Version)
```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=$PYTORCH_CPU_WHEELS_DIR torch torchvision torchaudio
```

#### B. Install NeMo Toolkit
```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=$NEMO_WHEELS_DIR nemo_toolkit[asr]
```

---

## Part 3: Verification & Troubleshooting

After completing the installation, verify that everything is working correctly and consult this section if you encounter errors.

### Step 1: Verify the Installation

Run this one-line Python command to confirm that PyTorch and NeMo were installed successfully.

> [!NOTE]
> For this CPU-only setup, the output for `CUDA available` should be `False`.

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}'); import nemo.utils; print('NeMo utils imported successfully')"
```

### Step 2: Common Troubleshooting Steps

> [!WARNING] Dependency or Cache Errors
> If any `pip install` command fails due to dependency conflicts even after you've supplied all wheels, the `pip` cache may be causing issues. Purge it and retry the installation.
> ```bash
> pip cache purge
> ```

> [!WARNING] `sentencepiece` Error
> If you encounter an error related to `sentencepiece`, it means a required system-level dependency is missing. You must install it from the Arch User Repository (AUR). This step requires an internet connection.
> ```bash
> paru -S sentencepiece
> ```
