#### Scenario 1: Isolated Development
Create a clean, self-contained Python environment without installing packages globally on your Arch system. When the project is done, just delete the container and image, leaving no trace.

#### Scenario 2: Ephemeral Software Testing
Want to try a new tool like `redis` without cluttering your system?
```bash
# This downloads redis, runs it, gives you a command line,
# and --rm ensures it's completely deleted when you exit.
docker run -it --rm redis
```

#### Scenario 3: Self-Hosting Services
This is Docker's superpower. Easily run a personal cloud of applications on your powerful laptop.
