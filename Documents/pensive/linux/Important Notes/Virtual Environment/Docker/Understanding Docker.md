## Your Learning Journey

This guide is structured to take you from the "why" to the "how" in a logical progression. Click on any topic to dive deeper.

> [!question]- [[The Problem Docker Solves]]
> **Start Here:** Understand the "why" behind Docker. This note explains the classic "it works on my machine" dilemma and why traditional Virtual Machines were an inefficient solution.

> [!info]- [[Core Concepts of Docker]]
> **The Vocabulary:** Learn the four pillars of the Docker world. This note defines the `Dockerfile`, `Image`, `Container`, and `Registry`—the essential building blocks for everything you'll do.

> [!bug]- [[Under the Hood]]
> **The Magic Revealed:** Discover how Docker works without the overhead of a VM. This note dives into the Linux kernel features—`Namespaces` and `cgroups`—that provide Docker's signature speed and isolation.

> [!todo]- [[Getting Started on Arch Linux]]
> **Practical Setup:** A concise, step-by-step guide to installing, configuring, and running Docker on Arch Linux. It includes the crucial post-installation steps for a smooth, rootless workflow.

> [!example]- [[Practical Use Cases]]
> **Putting It to Work:** Explore real-world scenarios where Docker shines. This note showcases its power, from creating isolated development environments to self-hosting popular services like Plex or Vaultwarden.

> [!network]- [[Managing Data and Networks]]
> **Handling State:** A container's filesystem is temporary by default. This note covers the essential patterns for persisting data with `Volumes` and `Bind Mounts`, along with the fundamentals of container networking.

> [!success]- [[Orchestration with Docker Compose]]
> **Managing Complexity:** Go beyond single containers. This note introduces `Docker Compose`, the powerful tool for defining, linking, and running entire multi-container application stacks with a single command.

## Conclusion

> [!summary]
> Docker is a transformative tool. It's not magic; it's a clever application of Linux kernel features that provides a lightweight, fast, and portable alternative to VMs.
>
> *   For **daily use**, it's the ultimate sandbox for trying software without commitment.
> *   For **power users**, it's a paradigm for system administration, making it simple to deploy and manage complex applications.
>
> By following this learning path, you will gain a foundational knowledge of modern software logistics and be well-equipped to master the world of containerization.
