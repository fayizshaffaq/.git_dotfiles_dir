  SYSTEMCTL VS LOGINCTL FOR SUTTING DOWN AND LOGGING OUT AND OTHERS. 
------------------

  for hyprland initiated by uwsm, DON'T EVER USE window manager/desktop manager's native commands because the session is managed by uwsm. only use loginctl , and only when necessory use systemctl but never session's native mecanism to wind down the active session.
  only use these user level commands,the last flag is for logging out gracefuly.
  loginctl followed by any of these flags. 
  poweroff, reboot, suspend,loginctl terminate-session $XDG_SESSION_ID,

  if you're in a tty and haven't yet initialized a wm/dm use systemctl.
    systemctl followed by :-
    poweroff, reboot, suspend, soft-reboot, hybrid-sleep

  AUTO MOUNTING OF DRIVIES WHEN UNLOCKING FROM COMMANDLINE
--------------------------------------------

  this command to unlock a drive when it's encrypted. Note that it doesn't initiate the unlocked drive, you have to click it whitin thunar to initiate it. but you can also mount it with a simple command. make sure to specifiy your drive by finding it's name from lsblk.

udisksctl unlock --block-device /dev/nvme1n1p1

  mount it with a command, (since the entry for it already exists withing fstab you don't have to list the entrie mount command, just enter this instead) eg for the media partition. 

sudo mount /mnt/media
