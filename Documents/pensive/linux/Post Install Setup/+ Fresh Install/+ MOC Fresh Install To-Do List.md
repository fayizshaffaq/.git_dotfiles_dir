# Fresh Arch Linux Installation Checklist

This checklist provides a structured overview of essential tasks to perform after a fresh Arch Linux installation. Follow these steps to configure your system, restore your environment, and set up your applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]+
> Steps to be followed Sequentially.

### 1. Core System & Environment Setup

This phase focuses on critical system files, user environment, and restoring your base configuration.

- [ ] **Login with uwsm** 

```bash
exec uwsm start hyprland
```

- [ ] **Connect to the internet**: Depending on what you use, (ie tethering does not usually need to be setup) [[Network Manager]]

---

- [ ] *Optional but recommended* There are 2 commands that are long and complex, to prevent typos, it's recommended to copy paste them by SSH'ing into the PC from a phone or another pc, for referenced- not needed to refer to [[SSH]]

```bash
sudo systemctl start sshd && ip a
```

---

- [ ] **Restore Dotfiles:** Download the `git` bare repository and deploy the files on your PC [[Restore Backup On a Fresh Install]].

---

- [ ] **Link Restored Vault files to Obsidian** : open and link to existing vault. 
- When you open Obsidian for the first time, you'll be prompted with three options. Select "open Folder as Vault (Choose an existing folder of Markdown Files)" this directory should have been populated in ~/Documents/pensive/ after you restored the git files. 

- make sure to NOT create a new vault or sync. select the aforementioned option and navigate to the pensive directory to be selected as source for existing markdown files. 

- You can then copy paste commands from Obsidian on the same PC, no SSHing required

---

- [ ] **Set up GNOME Keyring:** Configure GNOME Keyring with PAM for password management. [[Gnome Keyring PAM]]

---

- [ ] **Enable UserSession Services**. 

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now pipewire.socket pipewire-pulse.socket wireplumber.service hypridle.service hyprpolkitagent.service
```

---

- [ ] **Set Default Shell:** Change the default shell from `bash` to `zsh` 
- To make Zsh your login shell, use the `chsh` (change shell) command and then enter your Password

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]-
> For the change to take full effect, you must **log out and log back in**. Simply opening a new terminal window is not enough.

- [ ] **Reboot** :

```bash
systemctl reboot
```

After logging back in, you can verify that your shell has been changed:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

The output should be `/bin/zsh` or `/usr/bin/zsh`.

---

- [ ] **Install `paru`:** Set up the `paru` AUR helper. [[Installing an AUR Helper]]

---

- [ ] **Install Warp and connect to it** or some packages might download excruciatingly slowly [[Warp Cloudflare]]

---

- [ ] **Install Core Applications:** Use `paru` to install your essential packages from the repositories and the AUR. [[AUR Packages]]

---

- [ ] **Enable Aur packages' services** [[AUR Package services]]

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now fwupd.service warp-svc.service asusd.service 
```

---

- [ ] Run Jdownloader once to let it downlaod all the files it needs to update it self. 
`just open it with rofi or wofi`

---

- [ ] **Create Directories** for Block device mount points. (only create the ones you have drives for)

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/{browser,windows,wdslow,wdfast,media,fast,slow,enclosure}
```

---

- [ ] **Update `fstab`:** Edit the fstab to reflect the new drives' UUIDs. **fstab requires unlocked UUIDs of block devices** [[fstab reference]] 
- find out UUID's of your relevant disks. boot, home & root are already set. don't touch those in fstab. 

```bash
lsblk -f
```
or 
```bash
sudo blkid
```

```bash 
sudo nvim /etc/fstab
```

- After making changes to the fstab file, make sure to reload the file into memory. 

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

---

- [ ] **Update Drive Unlock Script:** Change the UUID in your LUKS/drive unlocking script. **Both, lock and unlock scripts require Locked UUIDs**

- Test if it worked by running the unlock drive script for browser drive. There's an alias for it in the zshrc file, run this. and enter your password, Then check if it correctly mounted at /mnt/browser/

```bash
unlock browser
```

---

- [ ] *Optional* : Link Browser data to existing drive (only do if you have a seperate browser drive where you have exisitng browser data stored)

- Do Not Open Firefox until all steps are done (close it if it's open)

- First Completely Wipe Firefox Data on your current setup. 

- Removes the primary Firefox profile data
- Removes the parent .mozilla directory, catching all related data
- Clears the application cache for Firefox

```bash
rm -rf ~/.mozilla/firefox/ ~/.mozilla ~/.cache/mozilla
```

This command links the `.mozilla` folder from an external drive mounted at `/mnt/browser/.mozilla` to the location where Firefox expects to find it in the user's home directory.

```bash
sudo ln -s /mnt/browser/.mozilla ~/.mozilla
```

---

- [ ] **Comment out anything beyond  the end line of zshrc, if there is anything there,  to speed up your terminal:** :- 

```bash
nvim ~/.zshrc
```

>[!note]- Comment out beyond this part
> ===========================
> End of ~/.zshrc
> ============================

---

- [ ] *Optional*: **TLP config** : copy the tlp config to /etc/tlp.conf [[+ MOC tlp config]]

---

- [ ] *Optional*:**Create Disk Swap** [[Disk Swap]] 

---

- [ ] *Optional*: **Configure Auto-Login:** Set up automatic login on TTY1. [[+ MOC Auto Login]]

---

- [ ] *Optional*: **Configure Power Key:** Define the system's behavior when the power key is pressed. [[Power Key Behaviour]]

---

- [ ] Fix logratate by uncommenting size and compress in 

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/logrotate.conf
```

---

- [ ] fix being locked out if you enter incorrect password [[Incorrect Password Attempt Timeout]]

---

- [ ] **Reboot** 

```bash
systemctl reboot
```

---

### 2. Very Important to REMOVE the following configs if you have a PC other than Asus Tuf f15 2022 or a pc without a Dedicated GPU like NVIDIA or AMD

Fine-tune your Hyprland compositor and shell environment. These steps are often machine-specific.

> [!CAUTION]+
> The following steps involve hardware-specific settings. Adjust them carefully based on whether you are on Asus tuf 15 or another pc  and what GPU you are using.

## For non Asus tuf f15 laptops

> bind = ALT, 7, exec, hyprctl keyword monitor eDP-1,1920x1080@144,0x0,1.6

- [ ] Comment out this and replace it with this. 

> [!tip]- Comment out these lines 
> ```ini
>#FASTERWHISPER TTS
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, I, exec, ~/user_scripts/faster_whisper/faster_whisper_sst.sh
>
>#Nvidia Parakeet
>bind = $mainMod, I, exec, ~/user_scripts/parakeet/parakeet.sh

- [ ] for changing file manager from yazi to thunar. 

> [!tip]- to change yazi to thunar as default
>replace this line `$fileManager = yazi` with 
>```ini
>$fileManager = thunar
>```
>and then replace this line `bind = $mainMod, E, exec, kitty -e $fileManager` with 
>```ini
>bind = $mainMod, E, exec, $fileManager
>```
>and then finally run this command
>```bash
>xdg-mime default thunar.desktop inode/directory
>```
> explination of the command
> By running this command, you are telling your system, "From now on, whenever you are asked to 'open' a directory, use the application defined in thunar.desktop." This change is saved specifically for your user in the ~/.config/mimeapps.list file.
> xdg-mime default: This is the command to set a default application.
>thunar.desktop: This is the standard desktop entry for the Thunar application. The system looks for this file in /usr/share/applications/ to get information about how to run Thunar.
>inode/directory: This is the official MIME type for a folder or directory.
