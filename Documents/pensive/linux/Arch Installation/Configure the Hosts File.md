The `/etc/hosts` file provides a local lookup table for mapping IP addresses to hostnames. This step is crucial for ensuring your system can resolve its own hostname without relying on external DNS, which is important for the proper functioning of many applications and network services.

This step follows directly after [[Setting Hostname]].

1.  **Open the file for editing:**
    Use your preferred text editor to open the `/etc/hosts` file.

    ```bash
    nvim /etc/hosts
    ```

2.  **Verify and Add Hostname Entry:**
    The file should already contain default entries for `localhost`. You will add a new line to associate your system's hostname (e.g., `arch-desktop`) with a specific loopback IP address.

    Add the third line as shown below, replacing `your-hostname` with the name you set in the previous step.

    ```text
    # /etc/hosts: static lookup table for hostnames
    # <ip-address>  <hostname.domain.org> <hostname>

    127.0.0.1   localhost
    ::1         localhost
    127.0.1.1   your-hostname.localdomain your-hostname
    ```

> [!NOTE] Why use `127.0.1.1`?
> While `127.0.0.1` is the standard loopback address for the generic name `localhost`, using a separate address like `127.0.1.1` for the machine's specific hostname is a common and recommended convention. It prevents potential conflicts with software that is hardcoded to expect `localhost` to resolve only to `127.0.0.1`.

> [!IMPORTANT] Use Your Actual Hostname
> Remember to replace both instances of `your-hostname` with the actual hostname you configured in the [[Setting Hostname]] step. For example, if your hostname is `arch-desktop`, the line should be:
> ```text
> 127.0.1.1   arch-desktop.localdomain arch-desktop
> ```
