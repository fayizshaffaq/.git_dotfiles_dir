```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/dusklinux/.git_dotfiles_dir.git dusk
```

dont forget the period at the end '.' after a space.  
```bash
cp dusk/user_scripts/arch_iso_scripts/001_pre_chroot/* .
```

the scritps in your current directory, in sequential order. 
```bash
ls
```
eg:- 
```bash
./000_pre_install.sh
```

after you've run all the scripts 
```bash
arch-chroot /mnt
```

then this command again 

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/dusklinux/.git_dotfiles_dir.git dusk
```

dont forget the period at the end '.' after a space.  

```bash
cp dusk/user_scripts/arch_iso_scripts/001_post_chroot/* .
```

and the just run the 002_ORCHESTRA.sh script and nothing else. this script will automatically run all the other scripts. if a script fails for some reason, you could run that particualr script manually.
