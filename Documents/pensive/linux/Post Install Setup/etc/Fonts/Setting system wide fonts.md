You can control how the system substitutes and selects fonts by creating a `local.conf` file. This is powerful for setting your favorite fonts as the default for generic categories like `sans-serif`, `serif`, and `monospace`.

1.  **Create or Edit the Configuration File**
    You will need root privileges to edit this file. Use a text editor like `nvim` or `kate`.

    ```bash
    sudo nvim /etc/fonts/local.conf
    ```
