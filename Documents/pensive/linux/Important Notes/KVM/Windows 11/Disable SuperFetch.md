SuperFetch, also known as SysMain, is a standard Windows feature that preloads the apps you use the most frequently. Although Superfetch is useful, it consumes a significant amount of CPU and RAM as a background service.

To disable Superfetch, type services into the search box and press [Enter] to open the Services window.

In the Services window, look for SysMain. Right-click it and select Properties. Then disable the service.
