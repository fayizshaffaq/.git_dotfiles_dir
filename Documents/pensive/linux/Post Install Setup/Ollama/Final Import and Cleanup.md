The last step is to remove the temporary entries and create the final, clean, and correctly named model.

#### 1. Remove Temporary Models
Delete both model entries from Ollama using `ollama rm`.

```bash
ollama rm qwen3-temp:latest
ollama rm hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M
```
> [!NOTE]
> This command only removes the manifest entries (the "names"). The underlying data blob will not be deleted because it's still needed.

#### 2. Create the Final Model
Finally, use `ollama create` one last time with your perfected `Modelfile`. You can now give the model a clean, simple name.

```bash
ollama create qwen3:8b-q4 -f /path/to/your/perfect-qwen3-modelfile
```

Congratulations! You now have a perfectly configured model in Ollama, using your local GGUF file, with a clean name and all the correct parameters. You can verify with `ollama list`.

### Updating an Existing Model's Configuration

You can follow this same procedure if a model's template or parameters are updated on Hugging Face. As long as the GGUF file itself (`sha256sum`) has not changed, you can repeat this process to download the new `Modelfile` and rebuild your local model entry without re-downloading the data.
