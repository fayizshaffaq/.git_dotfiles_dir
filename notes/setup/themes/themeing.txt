    Manual Installation: You can also download themes from websites like GNOME-Look or GitHub. Once downloaded, you'll typically have a .zip or .tar.gz file. Extract this file, and move the resulting theme folder to one of the following directories:

        ~/.themes/ or ~/.local/share/themes/: For themes that are specific to your user.[1]

        /usr/share/themes/: For themes that will be available system-wide.[2]

Once you've installed a theme, you can use nwg-look to apply it.
