## Not Recommanded to install all at once but here it is anyway. 
[[All Packages at Once]]
# (Hyprland & Essentials)

This is a critical step where you install the core software for your system, including the graphical environment, drivers, and essential applications. The packages are installed in thematic groups across multiple commands to ensure a stable process and simplify troubleshooting.

> [!NOTE] Phased Installation Strategy
> Running these `pacman` commands separately is intentional. It allows `pacman` to resolve dependencies and download packages in manageable chunks. If one command fails, it's easier to identify the problematic package without halting the entire installation process.

### 1. Graphics Drivers & Core System Utilities 
This command installs essential drivers for Intel GPUs, Mesa for 3D graphics, Vulkan support, and key system tools for Btrfs and ZRAM.
- [ ] Status
```bash
pacman -S --needed intel-media-driver mesa vulkan-intel mesa-utils intel-gpu-tools libva libva-utils vulkan-icd-loader vulkan-tools intel-ucode btrfs-progs zram-generator
```

> [!note] Only install this if you have an **intel** mobile chip between **5th gen and 11th gen** (hardware encoding/decoding)
>```bash
>pacman -S --needed intel-media-sdk
> ```

### 2. Hyprland Window Manager & Wayland Components
Install the Hyprland compositor, Wayland compatibility layers, and the necessary GTK/Qt frameworks for application rendering.

```bash
pacman -S --needed hyprland xorg-xwayland uwsm qt5-wayland qt6-wayland xdg-desktop-portal-gtk gtk3 gtk4 nwg-look qt5ct qt6ct qt6-svg qt6-multimedia-ffmpeg kvantum hyprpolkitagent
```

### 3. System Integration & Fonts
Install Polkit for permissions, XDG portals for Hyprland integration, and essential Nerd Fonts for icons and terminal aesthetics.
- [ ] Status
```bash
pacman -S --needed xorg-xhost polkit xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland xdg-utils ttf-font-awesome ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd noto-fonts-emoji

> [!TIP] Installing Tesseract Language Data
> After the command above completes, `pacman` will prompt you to select optional packages for language data. For English support, find `tesseract-data-eng` in the list, type its corresponding number, and press Enter to install it. (USUALLY 30TH)

- (if you have an nvidia gpu and you don't install this while also restoring backup, you'll get an error logging in, make sure to uncomment this line in .config/uwsm/env-hyprland `export AQ_DRM_DEVICES=/dev/dri/card1`and if it still doesn't login, try commenting out the display thing `monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1.6` in the hyprland config )
