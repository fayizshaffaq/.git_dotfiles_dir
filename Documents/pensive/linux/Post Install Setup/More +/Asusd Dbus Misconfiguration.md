# Fixing asusd D-Bus Misconfiguration on Arch Linux

This guide provides a step-by-step solution to a common D-Bus configuration issue with the `asusd` service on Arch Linux and Fedora-based systems.

---

### The Problem: Incorrect Group Policy

The `asusd` service, which manages ASUS-specific hardware features, is often packaged with a D-Bus policy configured for Debian-based distributions. This policy grants permissions to the `sudo` user group.

However, Arch Linux uses the `wheel` group for administrative privileges by default, not `sudo`. Because the `sudo` group does not exist, the D-Bus policy fails, which can prevent `asusd` and related tools from functioning correctly.

> [!NOTE] Group Differences
> - **Debian/Ubuntu:** Use the `sudo` group for users who can run administrative commands.
> - **Arch Linux/Fedora:** Use the `wheel` group for the same purpose.

The misconfiguration is located in the `asusd.conf` file, which contains a policy block specifically for the `sudo` group.

### The Solution: Removing the Flawed Policy

To resolve this, we will edit the D-Bus configuration file and remove the incorrect policy block.

#### Step 1: Open the Configuration File

First, you need to open the `asusd.conf` file with a text editor.

> [!TIP] Administrative Privileges
> You will need `sudo` privileges to edit this system file. You can use any command-line text editor you are comfortable with, such as `nvim`, `vim`, or `nano`.

```bash
sudo nvim /usr/share/dbus-1/system.d/asusd.conf
```

#### Step 2: Delete the Incorrect Policy Block

Inside the file, locate and completely delete the `<policy>` block that references the `sudo` group. This block is usually found around line 9.

> [!CAUTION]
> Ensure you only remove the specified XML block. Deleting other parts of the file could break the service entirely.

**Remove this entire section:**
```xml
<policy group="sudo">
    <allow send_destination="xyz.ljones.Asusd"/>
    <allow receive_sender="xyz.ljones.Asusd"/>
</policy>
```

After removing it, save the file and exit the text editor.

#### Step 3: Apply the Changes

For the changes to take effect, you must restart the `asusd` service. This will force it to reload its D-Bus configuration.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart asusd.service
```

### Verification

Your `asusd` service should now be able to communicate correctly over D-Bus without permission errors. The fix is complete, and your ASUS-specific features should work as expected.
