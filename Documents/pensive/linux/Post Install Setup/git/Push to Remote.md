### Step 10: Push to the Remote

1.  **Ensure your branch is named `main`.** To check the current branch name, run `git_dotfiles branch`. If it's `master` or something else, rename it forcefully:
    ```bash
    git_dotfiles branch -M main
	```

	   OR
	rename it with grace with the small **-m**	
    ```bash
    git_dotfiles branch -m main
	```

2.  **Push your `main` branch to the remote.** The `-u` flag sets the upstream tracking reference, so future pushes can be done with a simple `git_dotfiles push`.
    ```bash
    git_dotfiles push -u origin main
    ```

Your dotfiles are now fully configured and backed up both locally and remotely. For future changes, the simple workflow is: `git_dotfiles_add_list` (if you updated the list), `git_dotfiles commit`, and `git_dotfiles push`.
