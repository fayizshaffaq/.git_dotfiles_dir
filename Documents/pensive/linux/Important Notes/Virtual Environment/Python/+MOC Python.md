# 🐍 Python Environment Management: A Complete Guide

Welcome to your central hub for mastering Python development environments on Arch Linux. This Map of Content (MOC) organizes the essential guides for managing both Python versions and project-specific packages. Following these best practices will ensure your development workflow is clean, reproducible, and conflict-free.

### 🚀 [[Python Setup]]: Managing Python Versions with `pyenv`
> This guide covers `pyenv`, the industry-standard tool for installing and switching between multiple Python versions on a single system. If you need to work on different projects that require different versions of Python (e.g., Python 3.8 for a legacy app and 3.11 for a new one), this is the place to start.

> **Inside, you'll find:**
> -   Step-by-step installation and configuration for `pyenv` on Arch Linux.
> -   Commands for installing, uninstalling, and switching between Python versions.
> -   The best-practice workflow for combining `pyenv` with `venv`.

### 📦 [[Python Commands]]: Managing Project Dependencies with `venv` & `pip`
> Learn to master Python's built-in tools for creating isolated project environments. This guide focuses on `venv` to create self-contained spaces and `pip` to manage the packages (dependencies) within them. This is a fundamental skill for preventing the "it works on my machine" problem.

> **Inside, you'll find:**
> -   How to create, activate, and deactivate virtual environments using `venv`.
> -   A comprehensive reference for `pip` commands to install, list, and manage project packages.
> -   Best practices for creating reproducible environments with `requirements.txt`.
