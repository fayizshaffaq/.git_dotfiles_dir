### Step 7: Create an Empty Remote Repository

Navigate to GitHub and create a new, empty repository.

> [!IMPORTANT] Do Not Initialize the Remote Repository
> When creating the repository on GitHub, **do not** add a `README`, `.gitignore`, or license file. Your local repository already contains the project's history. Initializing the remote with files would create a divergent history, complicating your first push. It must be a completely empty shell.
