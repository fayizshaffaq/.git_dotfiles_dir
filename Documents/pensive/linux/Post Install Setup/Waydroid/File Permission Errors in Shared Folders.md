### File Permission Errors in Shared Folders

**Problem:** Files and folders shared via a bind mount are visible in Waydroid but cannot be read or written to.

**Solution:** This is typically caused by restrictive file permissions on the host directory. You can grant open permissions to the directory and all its contents.

> [!WARNING] Security Implication of `chmod 777`
> The command `chmod 777 -R` grants read, write, and execute permissions to **all users** on your system for the specified directory and everything inside it. This is a potential security risk. Use it with caution, primarily on directories that do not contain sensitive data.

```bash
# Grant read/write/execute permissions to the shared host folder
sudo chmod 777 -R /mnt/zram1
```
