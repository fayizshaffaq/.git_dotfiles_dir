# Battery Care -- Charge thresholds
# Charging starts when the charger is connected and the charge level
# is below the start threshold. Charging stops when the charge level
# is above the stop threshold.
# Required hardware: Lenovo ThinkPads and other laptop brands are driven
#   via specific plugins:
# - Use the tlp-stat -b command to see if a plugin for your hardware is
#   active and to look up vendor-specific threshold values. Some
#   laptops support only 1 (on)/0 (off) instead of a percentage level.
# - If your hardware supports a start *and* a stop threshold, you must
#   specify both, otherwise TLP will refuse to apply the single threshold.
# - If your hardware supports only a stop threshold, set the start
#   value to 0.
# - The names of the batteries shown by tlp-stat -b don't have to match
#   the _BAT0 or _BAT1 parameter qualifiers. Please refer to [2]
#   to see which qualifier applies to which battery.
# For further explanation and all vendor specific details refer to
