# II. EFI Partition Synthesis

With the target disk selected from the [[Preliminary Identification]] step, we will now carve out and prepare the new EFI partition. This partition is the quintessential vessel for the system's bootloader. A size of 512 MB is a robust and prophylactic measure, providing ample space and preventing future constraints.

### 1. Create the EFI Partition

First, we'll create the partition itself. This command instructs `diskpart` to create a partition specifically designated for EFI use with a size of 512 megabytes.

```diskpart
create partition efi size=512
```

> [!WARNING] No Unallocated Space?
> If the command above fails with an error about insufficient space, it means your primary Windows partition occupies the entire disk. You must first shrink it to create the necessary 512 MB of unallocated space.
>
> 1.  **Select your main Windows volume** (replace `W` with the correct letter you identified earlier).
>     ```diskpart
>     select volume W
>     ```
> 2.  **Shrink the volume** by 512 MB.
>     ```diskpart
>     shrink desired=512
>     ```
> 3.  **Retry the creation command** once the shrink operation is complete.
>     ```diskpart
>     create partition efi size=512
>     ```

### 2. Format the Partition

A new partition is raw, unusable space. It must be formatted with a filesystem. The UEFI specification requires the **FAT32** filesystem for the EFI partition.

```diskpart
format quick fs=fat32 label="SYSTEM"
```

> [!TIP] Command Breakdown
> - `quick`: Performs a fast format, which is sufficient for a new, empty partition.
> - `fs=fat32`: Specifies the mandatory FAT32 file system.
> - `label="SYSTEM"`: Assigns a recognizable name to the partition, which helps in identifying it later.

### 3. Assign a Drive Letter

To access the newly formatted partition and copy the necessary boot files to it in the next stage, we must temporarily assign it a drive letter.

```diskpart
assign letter=S
```

> [!NOTE] Why the letter `S`?
> We use `S:` for 'System' because it is an uncommon drive letter, making it highly unlikely to conflict with other drives connected to your computer.

### 4. Verify the Partition Structure

Finally, let's verify that all our operations have succeeded. This command will display all volumes known to the system.

```diskpart
list vol
```

You should now see your new volume in the list. Look for a line that matches the following characteristics:
- **Size**: `512 MB`
- **Fs (Filesystem)**: `FAT32`
- **Label**: `SYSTEM`
- **Ltr (Letter)**: `S`

Once you have confirmed this, you are ready to proceed to [[Boot File Reconstruction]].
