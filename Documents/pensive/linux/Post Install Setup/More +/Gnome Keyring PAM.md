Of course. Here is a revised, clear, and aesthetically pleasing guide for setting up GNOME Keyring with PAM on Arch Linux, formatted for Obsidian.

# Guide: Configuring GNOME Keyring with PAM on Arch Linux

This guide provides a step-by-step process for integrating GNOME Keyring with the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) system. This configuration allows applications to securely store secrets like passwords and API keys, and it enables two key features:

1.  **Automatic Unlocking**: Your "login" keyring will automatically unlock when you log into your system.
2.  **Password Synchronization**: If you change your user password, the keyring's password will be updated automatically to match.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

First, you need to install the core components. `gnome-keyring` is the background service that manages secrets, and `libsecret` is the library that applications use to communicate with it.

> [!TIP] Optional: Install Seahorse for a GUI
> The `seahorse` package provides a graphical interface to view and manage your stored keys and passwords. It is not required for the keyring to function but can be very helpful for troubleshooting and management.

Execute the following command to install the necessary packages:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed gnome-keyring libsecret
```

### Step 2: Configure PAM for Auto-Unlock

This is the most critical step. By editing the PAM configuration for `login`, you instruct the system to interact with the GNOME Keyring during the authentication process.

> [!WARNING] Caution: Editing PAM Files
> Be extremely careful when editing files in `/etc/pam.d/`. An incorrect configuration can lock you out of your system, requiring a live USB to fix. Double-check every character before saving.

1.  Open the PAM login configuration file using a text editor with root privileges:

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/pam.d/login
```

2.  Add the following lines to the file. A good practice is to place them at the end of their respective sections (`auth`, `session`, `password`).

```ini
auth       optional     pam_gnome_keyring.so
session    optional     pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start
password   optional     pam_gnome_keyring.so
```

#### What Do These Lines Do?

| Type | Module | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `auth` | `pam_gnome_keyring.so` | Unlocks the keyring using the password you provide at login. |
| `session` | `pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start` | Starts the `gnome-keyring-daemon` and sets the necessary environment variables as your session begins. |
| `password` | `pam_gnome_keyring.so` | Intercepts user password changes to keep the keyring password synchronized. |

### A Note on Manual Startup (e.g., in Hyprland)

You might find guides that suggest starting the daemon manually in a startup script, using a command like this:

```bash
# This is NOT needed with the PAM configuration above
exec-once = /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=secrets
```

> [!INFO] This Step is Unnecessary
> With the PAM configuration in place, specifically the `session ... auto_start` line, the daemon is already started correctly at login. Adding a manual `exec-once` command is redundant and can sometimes cause conflicts or prevent the keyring from unlocking properly. **The PAM method is the correct and recommended approach.**

After completing these steps and rebooting, your GNOME Keyring should be fully integrated and unlock automatically upon login.
