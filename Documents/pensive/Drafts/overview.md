1. waydroid as regular apps, native performance. 
2. doesn't try to be everything all at once, the diffrence is, installtion size of around 4 Gigs. as opposed to windows that takes up 60 Gb on a fresh install. 
3. zram swap and as block storage. 
4. different font hyprlegible. 
5. startup times improved. 
6. power consumtpion lowered. /lower heat longitivity 
7. no antivirus needed
8. free alternatives libre office and gimp. 
9. os is a bootloader for the browser, and the browsing experience is teh same 
10. windwos passthrough 
11. no key logging 
12. no taking a screenshot of your pc with recall every 5 second. increases storage space, disk writtes. power consumption and ram consumtion and it's because of things like this that your ram usage is over 5 gigs on a fresh install without any of your apps added at all. 
13. Since everything is done on computers these days, people spend a lot of time on their computers. And having an environment that is made by you, for you, is a better overall experience because you're much more connected to everything that's on your computer as opposed to things just being there and never being used and sometimes even being used for malicious purposes.
14. microsoft doesn't even run windows on there servers they run linux, 
15. becuase you can have linux running for years without any problem, and you can even update it withotu needing to restart which is  alot more than windows can say for itself. 
16. apps run so smooth. 
17. Gaming is improving at expinanctial speed, espeically with proton, thanks to steam. 
18. While there's a somewhat of an argument for people using Windows to not switch to Linux because they use because they play one of the few games that is currently unavailable on Linux there is absolutely no reason for Mac users to not switch because almost 90% or 95% of the things available on the Mac are available on Linux because at the very core they're both Unix based systems.
19. Microsoft themselves run linux on there servers 
20. ublock origin. 



when have you ever heard of any other operating system being so essential and widly used that all the other operating systems allow users to use that operating system within there own operating system, you don't see apple allowig people to nativly use windows on mac, nor do you see it happening other way around but these are both operating systems that have full blown support for linux that's what windows subsystem for linux is and same with apple's containorizaton to bring linux support for running apps, becuase tha'ts how important linux is. 



heres a geekbench score for the same machine on windows and linux, you see an uptick of anywhere from 10 - 30 percent. my version of windows 11 is as good as windows is going to get because it's debloated with a lot of the junk ripped out and it's still incuring a 10 percent performance cost. what does that tell you?? 

if you use a regular version of windows with antivirus, the perfromacne cost is close to 50-60 percent. you can see your cpu spiking when your defender is scanning, it's constantly monitoring your system and that is resource intensive. 

ollama is another one here's ollama running within windows vs running it on linux. the performace uplift is insane. 

I use whisper for speech to text and kokors for text to speech to hear something out and it's kinda insance that a 80 MB model is so good, and not just you can have it have any voice you want. between santa, chinese, ausatralian, british, indian. or anything else you want all from the same damn model. how insane is that. 

linux is free, now, Peopel like to say it's not relaly free because youre' paying for it with your time. which is absolute bull shit. 
you could use linux wihtout ever having to know how it works just use one of the ready made images available, or go the route of understnding what linux is. i'm not a programmer, i don't know how to code, i was able to learn linux, especially if you're a curious perosn, you can ask ai, infinately regressive why questions until you truly understand what linux is and how it works. and that is quite an interesting topic you have add and are a little autisitc, 
I have extreme attention defesit and this was the first time in my life outside of video games, i was so tunnel visioned on setting up linux for 2 month that i let everything else fall by the way side. I dont see that as a negative because now i'm so much more educated than i was two months ago. 

Here's a magical thing about using linux in 2025 and this is only going to get so much better, everytime i need a certain thing to be done, i create a script for it, i feed it off into an LLM and a few triel and errors later i have a working script that does what i want. I have no idea about how these scripts work, i can't read the code but it works. It's so stupidly easy to create custom scripts these days. 

 when you use Linux it's no longer a thing that is out there you you you feel more connected to the operating system everything is snappy everything is fluid and it's yours it's it's yours it's it's not been made for you by someone else who thinks what you may want but it's been made by you for what you want and that's a major selling point and just the process of doing it yourself figuring out what applications you want and what it is you need and just having only those allows for a lot of things first of which is a massive performance boost is a major one











Okay, now I'm starting to wonder how long this will take and how long it will happen for. But we should all know in a bit, because that's what matters the most, is getting a good read on how much data is being used. I guess I'm going to have to keep talking so there's something in the audio file that is not completely blank. Because what's that going to be useful for, right? The good thing is I accidentally went somewhere else. I shouldn't have gone here because I was running this command. Okay, now it's done from 34 to this. I want to see the.
