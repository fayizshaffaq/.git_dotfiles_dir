In the Overview section, make sure the chipset is set to Q35 and the firmware is set to UEFI.
The Q35 chipset natively supports PCIe and provides improved PCI-E pass-through support.

The UEFI firmware option, on the other hand, enables Secure Boot, which is required for Windows 11. When using the UEFI firmware, you can take internal snapshots while the guest is shut down but not while it is running.
