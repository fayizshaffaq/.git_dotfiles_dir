this script works, i tested it multiple times. the bcid is the first segment of the saved .cap file in the default direcotry (~/Documents/wifi_captures)

the bcid or what ever it's called (it's required to be entered right after you select the cap file) the bcid number is the number that's the first segment of the name of the cap file but after ever two digits it has to be seperated by ":" a colon or what ever it's called. this works on fedora perfectly

the password.txt file will be downloaded automaticallly but you could create one as well, just create a text file with all the possible potenntial passwords eg
1234567890
1234567890.1
1234567890.123
qwertyu
password
pass12345
.123456789
and on and so fourth and save that text file.
