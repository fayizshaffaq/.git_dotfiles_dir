telling someone to download more ram is a meme but i'm about to show you how you can triple or in some cases quatriple both your  ram and storage, if you have an ancient pc with 4 gigs of ram you can turn it into 16 gigs of ram  out of it. and if you have 8 gigs you can turn it into 32 gigs. and it works exacly the same for any type of storage devices old mechanical harddrives or ssds, and i'm not just talking about linux using less ram and storage, no no no no no, i'm talking abot actually being able to strore 3-4 times as much on both your ram and storage. it blew my mind that this was even a possibility and that i hadn't heard of it. Its a damning endictment of all the tech channels that they have failed to let there viewers know about this. 

I spent a whole day testing it to make sure it worked and lo and behold it's nothing short of magic, I'll be showing you exaclty how i did it it's quite straight forward, even if you dont do what i did just being aware of this technology existing will come in handy if you're running low on storage or ram in the future. I'll be sharing every last thing i've learned in these last 64 days. So you don't have to spend all that time figuring it out yourself.
