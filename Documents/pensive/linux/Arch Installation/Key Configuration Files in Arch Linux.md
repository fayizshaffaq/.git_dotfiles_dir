During a manual Arch Linux installation, you will interact with several critical configuration files. Understanding their purpose is essential for both the initial setup and future system maintenance. This note serves as a quick reference for these important file paths.

> [!TIP] Editing Safely
> Before modifying any system configuration file, it's wise to create a backup. You can do this easily with the `cp` command:
> ```bash
> cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
> ```

### Core System & Boot Configuration

This table outlines the most common files you'll edit during the installation process.

| File Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ` /etc/fstab ` | **File System Table**: Defines how disk partitions and other block devices are mounted into the filesystem. This file is typically generated by `genfstab` and then verified manually. |
| ` /etc/mkinitcpio.conf ` | **Initial RAM Disk**: Configures the initial RAM filesystem (initramfs). You edit this file to add necessary modules (e.g., for `btrfs` or `nvidia`), hooks, and binaries required during the early boot process before the root filesystem is mounted. |
| ` /etc/default/grub ` | **GRUB Defaults**: The primary file for customizing the GRUB bootloader. You modify this file to set kernel parameters, change the default boot entry, adjust the menu timeout, and configure themes. |
| ` /boot/grub/grub.cfg ` | **GRUB Configuration**: The main GRUB configuration file that is read at boot time. |

> [!WARNING] Do Not Edit Directly
> The `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` file is automatically generated. **You should never edit it by hand.** After making changes to `/etc/default/grub` or other GRUB scripts, you must regenerate this file by running:
> ```bash
> grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
> ```

### Host, Network & Localization

These files control the system's identity, network name resolution, and language settings.

| File Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ` /etc/hostname ` | Contains a single line with the name of your computer (e.g., `arch-desktop`). |
| ` /etc/hosts ` | Provides static, local DNS resolution, mapping IP addresses to hostnames. At a minimum, it should contain entries for `localhost`. |
| ` /etc/locale.gen ` | Lists all available system locales. You must uncomment the locales you wish to use (e.g., `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8`) and then run the `locale-gen` command. |
| ` /etc/locale.conf ` | Sets the default system-wide locale that was generated from `locale.gen`. |

### Package Management & User Permissions

These files manage software sources and administrative privileges.

| File Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ` /etc/pacman.conf ` | The main configuration file for the `pacman` package manager. Here you can enable repositories (like `multilib`), ignore packages, and set other global options. |
| ` /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist ` | A list of server URLs from which `pacman` downloads packages. It's recommended to manage this file with a tool like `reflector` to prioritize the fastest and most up-to-date mirrors. |
| ` /etc/sudoers ` | Configures which users and groups are granted administrative privileges via the `sudo` command. |

> [!NOTE] Use `visudo`
> To prevent syntax errors that could lock you out of administrative access, always edit the `/etc/sudoers` file using the `visudo` command. It checks the file for errors before saving.
