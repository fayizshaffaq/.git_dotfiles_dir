i also had to curate a list of pacakges i wanted, the process of searching for packages and realizing how i had to download a package for literlly every single thing gave me a true appriciation for how modular linux is, there's absolutely zero stuff on my setup that i didn't intentionally put there. Everysingle thing is handpicked by me. which makes it so much personal. and it's not like there's one package for each thing, There's like 10 alternatives for each and evyrthign thing. for instance for network setup, you can choose from a list of all these things, and given that i like to know the difference between all of them and pick the best one for my needs, i had to research each and everything one by one, which took an ungodly amount of time.
