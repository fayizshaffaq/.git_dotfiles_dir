A password must be set for the `root` user to secure the system. This account has full administrative privileges.

### 1. Set the Password

Run the `passwd` command. You will be prompted to enter and then re-enter a new password. For security, nothing will be displayed on the screen as you type.

```bash
passwd
```

> [!WARNING]
> It is strongly recommended to create a separate, non-root user account for daily tasks to minimize the risk of accidental system-wide changes. You will do this in the next step.

> [!TIP] Choose a Strong Password
> A strong password is your system's primary defense. Use a complex mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to enhance security.
